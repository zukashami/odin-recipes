        <h4 class="ingredients">Ingredients:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
            <li>Â½ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, preferably glass.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Stir bananas, milk, and cinnamon in another bowl. Beat sugar and butter together in a third bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir banana mixture into butter mixture; mix in flour mixture until just blended. Fold in chocolate chips; pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
